    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

      <li>Â½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chile paste</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>
        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes

      <li>
        In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste;
        stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an additional 30 seconds.
        Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is
        no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and
        keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the emptied pan combine the onion, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry
        until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining soy
        sauce, cooked noodles, and the chicken mixture to pan and mix to blend.
        Serve and enjoy!
