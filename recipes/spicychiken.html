  <h2>Best spicy chicken noodles you'll ever taste.</h2>

  <p>No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy chicken noodles dish is perfect for using up leftover chicken.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul>
      <li>1 large carrot</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
      <li>Â½ cup chopped green onions</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>

  <ol>
      <li>Place carrots, cabbage, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic in a mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
      <li>Mix chicken broth, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, sriracha sauce, and red pepper flakes together in a separate mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Place dry rice noodles in a large mixing bowl. Cover with about 6 cups boiling water; add a pinch of salt. Stir from time to time until noodles are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain; cool with cold water. Drain thoroughly. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add shredded chicken; drizzle with sesame oil. Toss to coat.</li>
      <li>Heat large skillet over high heat; drizzle in vegetable oil. When oil is hot (almost but not quite smoking), add the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until vegetables are hot and steamy, 1 or 2 minutes. Pour in sauce; cook and stir over high heat until sauce starts to bubble, about 1 minute. Add noodles and chicken. Cook and stir to blend ingredients and ensure ingredients are hot, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add chopped cilantro; stir.</li>
  </ol>
